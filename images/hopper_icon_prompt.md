# HOPPER Icon - AI Image Generation Prompt

## For Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Adobe Firefly

---

### Primary Prompt

A square app icon with a dark navy background (#060d1a). The icon depicts a **IBM punch card shape** — a rectangle with the top-right corner clipped at 45 degrees — rendered entirely from floating **COBOL punctuation characters**: periods `.`, hyphens `-`, and asterisks `*` arranged in horizontal rows, glowing in cyan and teal (#00c8a0, #0096c7). The punctuation characters form the visible texture and silhouette of the punch card, similar to how embers form a shape. In the exact center of the card is a large, bold, glowing capital letter **H** in warm white with a soft cyan-teal radiant halo, identical in style to a neon sign — the H appears to illuminate the surrounding punctuation characters. The overall color palette is deep navy, teal, seafoam green, and cyan. The card has a subtle inner glow along its edges in aqua. The top of the card has a row of small rectangular punch holes. The style is cinematic digital art, high contrast, glowing, dark background, icon design, professional, 1:1 square format, no text other than the letter H and punctuation symbols.

### Style Reference Notes (tell the AI)

> "Match the style of the BLAZE programming language icon — where `{;}`  curly braces and semicolons are arranged to form a flame shape. Apply the same concept but using COBOL punctuation (`. - *`) arranged to form a punch card shape. Same glow quality, same dark background treatment, same centered glowing letter approach."

### DALL-E 3 Specific Version

```
Create a professional app icon on a dark navy (#060d1a) square background. Design a punch card shape (rectangle with top-right corner cut at 45 degrees) where the entire card silhouette and texture is constructed from glowing COBOL programming punctuation: periods (.), hyphens (-), and asterisks (*) arranged in horizontal rows like card columns. Use a cyan and teal color palette with the punctuation characters glowing in #00c8a0 and #0096c7 against the dark background. Place a large bold capital letter "H" in the center, glowing in warm white with a soft teal radiant halo, as if backlit. Include a row of small rectangular punch holes along the top of the card. The overall effect should feel like the punctuation characters are luminous and hovering, forming the card shape through their collective glow — similar to how embers form a shape in fire photography. Dark, cinematic, high-contrast digital art style.

### Adobe Firefly / Generic Version

```
App icon design: a punch card (IBM style, rectangle with clipped top-right corner) built from glowing programming punctuation symbols — periods, hyphens, asterisks — in cyan and teal on a very dark navy background. The punctuation characters form horizontal rows across the card, glowing and luminous. A large glowing white capital H sits in the center with a teal radiant glow. Small rectangular punch holes line the top edge. Cinematic, high contrast, dark background, professional icon style.

### Tips for Best Results

- If the AI ignores the punch card shape, try adding: *"the overall silhouette must read as a rectangular punch card with one clipped corner"*
- If the H gets lost, try: *"the letter H should be the brightest element in the image, glowing like a neon light"*
- If punctuation isn't prominent enough: *"the . - * characters should be large enough to be individually readable, not microscopic texture"*
- Run 4 variations and pick the best — the concept is complex enough that results will vary significantly
- In Midjourney, try `--no flames fire orange` to prevent it from defaulting to warm fire tones
